# seo_tools
A small collection of script and fragments to help create automated SEO Tools with python

## psi_report_summary_example.py
This script pings Google's Pagespeed API, formats the results into a JSON file and then extracts a few of the data points previously available in the "resource_sumamry" audit that is no longer in the latest versions of Lighthouse. 

This is not intended to be a complete script, but instead a proof of concept useful for those attempting to rebuild this data.
